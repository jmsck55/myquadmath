How to compile "myquadmath" on Windows.

1. Download "GCC" with "quadmath.h"
You can get it as part of Strawberry Perl:
http://strawberryperl.com/

Example:
http://strawberryperl.com/download/5.30.0.1/strawberry-perl-5.30.0.1-64bit-portable.zip

2. Edit "setenv_gcc64.bat" and "setenv_gcc32.bat" as needed to update
"CPATH" and "PATH" to the include directory of "quadmath.h" and the path of
"gcc" respectively.  Windows uses ';' semicolon, Unix clones, such as Linux, 
FreeBSD, macOS, or Cygwin on Windows, use a colon ':' for separating 
directories in system environment variables.

3. Double-click on compile64.bat or compile32.bat, respectively, based on which
tool-chain you are going to use, 64-bit gcc or 32-bit gcc.

4. Press Enter when prompted.

5. To install, put the generated *.dll file into a directory included by the
"PATH" variable. Or,
Have all the DLLs you need in the PATH variable or in your working directory.

6. Finally, use the DLL functions in your program. There are a few examples 
that came with this software.

7. Lookup functions in GCC's documentation of "quadmath.h"

Example:
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-9.1.0/libquadmath/

8. Test out the functions, so that you know how to use them, before making 
production software.

9. Compile your program using any software language that can use Dynamic-Link 
Libraries (DLLs).
